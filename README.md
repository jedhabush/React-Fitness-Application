# Description

I have been going to the gym recently, so I thought it would be cool to create an application that enables me to choose and learn about different exercise categories and specific muscle groups. Someone might ask, "Why don't you just use an existing app?" My answer to that would be, "Where is the fun in just doing that?" There's nothing better than eating a meal that you cooked yourself.

## Features

1- Browse thousands of practical exercises examples built with [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/pricing). <br/>
2- Pagination and display exercise details. <br/>
3- Get related videos from YouTube built with [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/h0p3rwe/api/youtube-search-and-download/pricing). <br/>
4- The app is fully responsive. <br/>

# Tech Stack

• ReactJs. <br/>
• [Material UI](https://mui.com/): Since I used MUI when I built [YouTube clone](https://github.com/jedhabush/Youtube_Clone) app. I was impressed by it so I decided to use it one more time and explore it further. <br/>
• [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/hub): I used Rapid API during the development of [YouTube clone](https://github.com/jedhabush/Youtube_Clone) app. This time I used two different APIs that serve different aspects of the project but share common purposes. <br/>

# Notes and Remarks

If you have any issues displaying any videos or exercises then most likely the API requests from RAPID API have been exeeded.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
